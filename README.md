## Source

All credit for the original code to the inimitable [Mary Rose Cook](https://maryrosecook.com/), from this [repo](https://github.com/maryrosecook/strange-loop/tree/master/space-invaders), which was the source code for talks she gave around 2014. Her code has been slightly ~butchered~ modified for easier testing.
